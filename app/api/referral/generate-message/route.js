  Dear ${referrer},

  I hope you're doing well. I'm interested in applying for the "${jobRole}" role at ${company} and would appreciate your referral. If you're comfortable, Iâ€™d be grateful for your support. Please let me know if you need any details from my end.

  Looking forward to your response.

  Best regards,
